according 1
to 1
the 1

public 1

thought 1
that 1

right 1

for 1

they 1

until 1
they 1
knew 1
better 1
what 1
the 1

the 1
study 1
describes 1
several 1
scenarios 1
for 1
public 1
libraries 1
as 1
the 1
nren 1
evolves 1
some 1
may 1
simply 1
choose 1
to 1
ignore 1
the 1
sweeping 1
technological 1
changes 1
in 1
information 1
transfer 1
they 1
may 1
continue 1
to 1
exist 1
by 1
purveying 1
high 1
demand 1
items 1
and 1
traditional 1
services 1
but 1
they 1
may 1
find 1
it 1
increasingly 1
difficult 1
to 1
maintain 1
funding 1
levels 1
as 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
looks 1
elsewhere 1
for 1
their 1
information 1
and 1
reference 1
needs 1
the 1
public 1
library 1
may 1
find 1
itself 1
servicing 1
only 1
the 1
information 1
disenfranchised 1
while 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
community 1
finds 1
and 1
pays 1
for 1
other 1
solutions 1
as 1
the 1
study 1
explains 1
while 1
embracing 1
and 1
exploiting 1
networked 1
information 1
and 1
services 1
successfully 1
transitioned 1
libraries 1
also 1
maintain 1
high 1
visibility 1
and 1
high 1
demand 1
traditional 1
services 1
but 1
resources 1
will 1
be 1
reallocated 1
from 1
collections 1
and 1
less 1
visible 1
services 1
to 1
support 1
their 1
involvement 1
in 1
the 1
network 1
all 1
services 1
will 1
be 1
more 1
client 1
centered 1
and 1
demand 1
based 1
and 1
the 1
library 1
will 1
consciously 1
seek 1
opportunities 1
to 1
deliver 1
new 1
types 1
of 1
information 1
resources 1
and 1
services 1
electronically 1
in 1

nren 1

access 1
to 1

nren 1
and 1
will 1
compete 1
successfully 1
against 1
other 1
information 1
providers 1
in 1
its 1
networked 1
role 1
the 1
library 1
can 1
serve 1
as 1
a 1
central 1
point 1
of 1

the 1

senator 1

which 1

many 1
of 1
these 1

unfortunately 1
the 1

not 1
passed 1

the 1
closing 1

however 1
that 1
it 1
will 1

in 1

aladdin 1
did 1
not 1
mend 1
his 1
ways 1
one 1
day 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
playing 1
in 1
the 1
streets 1
as 1
usual 1
a 1
stranger 1
asked 1
him 1
his 1
age 1
and 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
mustapha 1
the 1
tailor 1
i 1
am 1
sir 1
replied 1
aladdin 1
but 1
he 1
died 1
a 1
long 1
while 1
ago 1
on 1
this 1
the 1
stranger 1
who 1
was 1
a 1
famous 1
african 1
magician 1
fell 1
on 1
his 1
neck 1
and 1
kissed 1
him 1
saying 1
i 1
am 1
your 1
uncle 1
and 1
knew 1
you 1
from 1
your 1
likeness 1
to 1
my 1
brother 1
go 1
to 1
your 1
mother 1
and 1
tell 1
her 1
i 1
am 1
coming 1
aladdin 1
ran 1
home 1
and 1
told 1
his 1
mother 1
of 1
his 1
newly 1
found 1
uncle 1
indeed 1
child 1
she 1
said 1
your 1
father 1
had 1
a 1
brother 1
but 1
i 1
always 1
thought 1
he 1
was 1
dead 1
however 1
she 1
prepared 1
supper 1
and 1
bade 1
aladdin 1
seek 1
his 1
uncle 1
who 1
came 1
laden 1
with 1
wine 1
and 1
fruit 1
he 1
fell 1
down 1
and 1
kissed 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
mustapha 1
used 1
to 1
sit 1
bidding 1
aladdin 1
s 1
mother 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
surprised 1
at 1
not 1
having 1
seen 1
him 1
before 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
forty 1
years 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
he 1
then 1
turned 1
to 1
aladdin 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
his 1
trade 1
at 1
which 1
the 1
boy 1
hung 1
his 1
head 1
while 1
his 1
mother 1
burst 1
into 1
tears 1
on 1
learning 1
that 1
aladdin 1
was 1
idle 1
and 1
would 1
learn 1
no 1
trade 1
he 1
offered 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
shop 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
stock 1
it 1
with 1
merchandise 1
next 1
day 1
he 1
bought 1
aladdin 1
a 1
fine 1
suit 1
of 1
clothes 1
and 1
took 1
him 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
city 1
showing 1
him 1
the 1
sights 1
and 1
brought 1
him 1
home 1
at 1
nightfall 1
to 1
his 1
mother 1
who 1
was 1
overjoyed 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
son 1
so 1
fine 1
next 1
day 1
the 1
magician 1
led 1
aladdin 1
into 1
some 1
beautiful 1
gardens 1
a 1
long 1
way 1
outside 1
the 1
city 1
gates 1
they 1
sat 1
down 1
by 1
a 1
fountain 1
and 1
the 1
magician 1
pulled 1
a 1
cake 1
from 1
his 1
girdle 1
which 1
he 1
divided 1
between 1
them 1
then 1
they 1
journeyed 1
onwards 1
till 1
they 1
almost 1
reached 1
the 1
mountains 1
aladdin 1
was 1
so 1
tired 1
that 1
he 1
begged 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
but 1
the 1
magician 1
beguiled 1
him 1
with 1
pleasant 1
stories 1
and 1
lead 1
him 1
on 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
himself 1
at 1
last 1
they 1
came 1
to 1
two 1
mountains 1
divided 1
by 1
a 1
narrow 1
valley 1
we 1
will 1
go 1
no 1
farther 1
said 1
his 1
uncle 1
i 1
will 1
show 1
you 1
something 1
wonderful 1
only 1
do 1
you 1
gather 1
up 1
sticks 1
while 1
i 1
kindle 1
a 1
fire 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
lit 1
the 1
magician 1
threw 1
on 1
it 1
a 1
powder 1
he 1
had 1
about 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
saying 1
some 1
magical 1
words 1
the 1
earth 1
trembled 1
a 1
little 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
them 1
disclosing 1
a 1
square 1
flat 1
stone 1
with 1
a 1
brass 1
ring 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
to 1
raise 1
it 1
by 1
aladdin 1
tried 1
to 1
run 1
away 1
but 1
the 1
magician 1
caught 1
him 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
a 1
blow 1
that 1
knocked 1
him 1
down 1
what 1
have 1
i 1
done 1
uncle 1
he 1
said 1
piteously 1
whereupon 1
the 1
magician 1
said 1
more 1
kindly 1
fear 1
nothing 1
but 1
obey 1
me 1
beneath 1
this 1
stone 1
lies 1
a 1
treasure 1
which 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
yours 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
may 1
touch 1
it 1
so 1
you 1
must 1
do 1
exactly 1
as 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
at 1
the 1
word 1
treasure 1
aladdin 1
forgot 1
his 1
fears 1
and 1
grasped 1
the 1
ring 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
told 1
saying 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
his 1
father 1
and 1
grandfather 1
the 1
stone 1
came 1
up 1
quite 1
easily 1
and 1
some 1
steps 1
appeared 1
go 1
down 1
said 1
the 1
magician 1
at 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
those 1
steps 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
an 1
open 1
door 1
leading 1
into 1
three 1
large 1
halls 1
tuck 1
up 1
your 1
gown 1
and 1
go 1
through 1
them 1
without 1
touching 1
anything 1
or 1
you 1
will 1
die 1
instantly 1
these 1
halls 1
lead 1
into 1
a 1
garden 1
of 1
fine 1
fruit 1
trees 1
walk 1
on 1
till 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
niche 1
in 1
a 1
terrace 1
where 1
stands 1
a 1
lighted 1
lamp 1
pour 1
out 1
the 1
oil 1
it 1
contains 1
and 1
bring 1
it 1
me 1
he 1
drew 1
a 1
ring 1
from 1
his 1
finger 1
and 1
gave 1
it 1
to 1
aladdin 1
bidding 1
him 1
prosper 1
aladdin 1
found 1
everything 1
as 1
the 1
magician 1
had 1
said 1
gathered 1
some 1
fruit 1
off 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
having 1
got 1
the 1
lamp 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
mouth 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
the 1
magician 1
cried 1
out 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
hurry 1
make 1
haste 1
and 1
give 1
me 1
the 1
lamp 1
this 1
aladdin 1
refused 1
to 1
do 1
until 1
he 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
cave 1
the 1
magician 1
flew 1
into 1
a 1
terrible 1
passion 1
and 1
throwing 1
some 1
more 1
powder 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
fire 1
he 1
said 1
something 1
and 1
the 1
stone 1
rolled 1
back 1
into 1
its 1
place 1
the 1
man 1
left 1
the 1
country 1
which 1
plainly 1
showed 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
no 1
uncle 1
of 1
aladdin 1
s 1
but 1
a 1
cunning 1
magician 1
who 1
had 1
read 1
in 1
his 1
magic 1
books 1
of 1
a 1
wonderful 1
lamp 1
which 1
would 1
make 1
him 1
the 1
most 1
powerful 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
though 1
he 1
alone 1
knew 1
where 1
to 1
find 1
it 1
he 1
could 1
only 1
receive 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
another 1
he 1
had 1
picked 1
out 1
the 1
foolish 1
aladdin 1
for 1
this 1
purpose 1
intending 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
kill 1
him 1
afterwards 1
for 1
two 1
days 1
aladdin 1
remained 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
crying 1
and 1
lamenting 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
clasped 1
his 1
hands 1
in 1
prayer 1
and 1
in 1
so 1
doing 1
rubbed 1
the 1
ring 1
which 1
the 1
magician 1
had 1
forgotten 1
to 1
take 1
from 1
him 1
immediately 1
an 1
enormous 1
and 1
frightful 1
genie 1
rose 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
earth 1
saying 1
what 1
wouldst 1
thou 1
with 1
me 1
i 1
am 1
the 1
slave 1
of 1
the 1
ring 1
and 1
will 1
obey 1
thee 1
in 1
all 1
things 1
aladdin 1
fearlessly 1
replied 1
deliver 1
me 1
from 1
this 1
place 1
whereupon 1
the 1
earth 1
opened 1
and 1
he 1
found 1
himself 1
outside 1
as 1
soon 1
as 1
his 1
eyes 1
could 1
bear 1
the 1
light 1
he 1
went 1
home 1
but 1
fainted 1
on 1
the 1
threshold 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
himself 1
he 1
told 1
his 1
mother 1
what 1
had 1
passed 1
and 1
showed 1
her 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
the 1
fruits 1
he 1
had 1
gathered 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
which 1
were 1
in 1
reality 1
precious 1
stones 1
he 1
then 1
asked 1
for 1
some 1
food 1
alas 1
child 1
she 1
said 1
i 1
have 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
spun 1
a 1
little 1
cotton 1
and 1
will 1
go 1
sell 1
it 1
aladdin 1
bade 1
her 1
keep 1
her 1
cotton 1
for 1
he 1
would 1
sell 1
the 1
lamp 1
instead 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
dirty 1
she 1
began 1
to 1
rub 1
it 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
fetch 1
a 1
higher 1
price 1
instantly 1
a 1
hideous 1
genie 1
appeared 1
and 1
asked 1
what 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
she 1
fainted 1
away 1
but 1
aladdin 1
snatching 1
the 1
lamp 1
said 1
boldly 1
fetch 1
me 1
something 1
to 1
eat 1
the 1
genie 1
returned 1
with 1
a 1
silver 1
bowl 1
twelve 1
silver 1
plates 1
containing 1
rich 1
meats 1
two 1
silver 1
cups 1
and 1
two 1
bottles 1
of 1
wine 1
aladdin 1
s 1
mother 1
when 1
she 1
came 1
to 1
herself 1
said 1
whence 1
comes 1
this 1
splendid 1
feast 1
ask 1
not 1
but 1
eat 1
replied 1
aladdin 1
so 1
they 1
sat 1
at 1
breakfast 1
till 1
it 1
was 1
dinner 1
time 1
and 1
aladdin 1
told 1
his 1
mother 1
about 1
the 1
lamp 1
she 1
begged 1
him 1
to 1
sell 1
it 1
and 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
devils 1
no 1
said 1
aladdin 1
since 1
chance 1
hath 1
made 1
us 1
aware 1
of 1
its 1
virtues 1
we 1
will 1
use 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
ring 1
likewise 1
which 1
i 1
shall 1
always 1
wear 1
on 1
my 1
finger 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
eaten 1
all 1
the 1
genie 1
had 1
brought 1
aladdin 1
sold 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
silver 1
plates 1
and 1
so 1
on 1
until 1
none 1
were 1
left 1
he 1
then 1
had 1
recourse 1
to 1
the 1
genie 1
who 1
gave 1
him 1
another 1
set 1
of 1
plates 1
and 1
thus 1
they 1
lived 1
many 1
years 1
one 1
day 1
aladdin 1
heard 1
an 1
order 1
from 1
the 1
sultan 1
proclaimed 1
that 1
everyone 1
was 1
to 1
stay 1
at 1
home 1
and 1
close 1
his 1
shutters 1
while 1
the 1
princess 1
his 1
daughter 1
went 1
to 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
bath 1
aladdin 1
was 1
seized 1
by 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
face 1
which 1
was 1
very 1
difficult 1
as 1
she 1
always 1
went 1
veiled 1
he 1
hid 1
himself 1
behind 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
bath 1
and 1
peeped 1
through 1
a 1
chink 1
the 1
princess 1
lifted 1
her 1
veil 1
as 1
she 1
went 1
in 1
and 1
looked 1
so 1
beautiful 1
that 1
aladdin 1
fell 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
her 1
at 1
first 1
sight 1
he 1
went 1
home 1
so 1
changed 1
that 1
his 1
mother 1
was 1
frightened 1
he 1
told 1
her 1
he 1
loved 1
the 1
princess 1
so 1
deeply 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
live 1
without 1
her 1
and 1
meant 1
to 1
ask 1
her 1
in 1
marriage 1
of 1
her 1
father 1
his 1
mother 1
on 1
hearing 1
this 1
burst 1
out 1
laughing 1
but 1
aladdin 1
at 1
last 1
prevailed 1
upon 1
her 1
to 1
go 1
before 1
the 1
sultan 1
and 1
carry 1
his 1
request 1
she 1
fetched 1
a 1
napkin 1
and 1
laid 1
in 1
it 1
the 1
magic 1
fruits 1
from 1
the 1
enchanted 1
garden 1
which 1
sparkled 1
and 1
shone 1
like 1
the 1
most 1
beautiful 1
jewels 1
she 1
took 1
these 1
with 1
her 1
to 1
please 1
the 1
sultan 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
trusting 1
in 1
the 1
lamp 1
the 1
grand 1
vizier 1
and 1
the 1
lords 1
of 1
council 1
had 1
just 1
gone 1
in 1
as 1
she 1
entered 1
the 1
hall 1
and 1
placed 1
herself 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
sultan 1
he 1
however 1
took 1
no 1
notice 1
of 1
her 1
she 1
went 1
every 1
day 1
for 1
a 1
week 1
and 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
place 1
when 1
the 1
council 1
broke 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
sixth 1
day 1
the 1
sultan 1
said 1
to 1
his 1
vizier 1
i 1
see 1
a 1
certain 1
woman 1
in 1
the 1
audience 1
chamber 1
every 1
day 1
carrying 1
something 1
in 1
a 1
napkin 1
call 1
her 1
next 1
time 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
find 1
out 1
what 1
she 1
wants 1
next 1
day 1
at 1
a 1
sign 1
from 1
the 1
vizier 1
she 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
foot 1
of 1
the 1
throne 1
and 1
remained 1
kneeling 1
until 1
the 1
sultan 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
rise 1
good 1
woman 1
and 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
you 1
want 1
she 1
hesitated 1
so 1
the 1
sultan 1
sent 1
away 1
all 1
but 1
the 1
vizier 1
and 1
bade 1
her 1
speak 1
freely 1
promising 1
to 1
forgive 1
her 1
beforehand 1
for 1
anything 1
she 1
might 1
say 1
she 1
then 1
told 1
him 1
of 1
her 1
son 1
s 1
violent 1
love 1
for 1
the 1
princess 1
i 1
prayed 1
him 1
to 1
forget 1
her 1
she 1
said 1
but 1
in 1
vain 1
he 1
threatened 1
to 1
do 1
some 1
desperate 1
deed 1
if 1
i 1
refused 1
to 1
go 1
and 1
ask 1
your 1
majesty 1
for 1
the 1
hand 1
of 1
the 1
princess 1
now 1
i 1
pray 1
you 1
to 1
forgive 1
not 1
me 1
alone 1
but 1
my 1
son 1
aladdin 1
the 1
sultan 1
asked 1
her 1
kindly 1
what 1
she 1
had 1
in 1
the 1
napkin 1
whereupon 1
she 1
unfolded 1
the 1
jewels 1
and 1
presented 1
them 1
he 1
was 1
thunderstruck 1
and 1
turning 1
to 1
the 1
vizier 1
said 1
what 1
sayest 1
thou 1
ought 1
i 1
not 1
to 1
bestow 1
the 1
princess 1
on 1
one 1
who 1
values 1
her 1
at 1
such 1
a 1
price 1
the 1
vizier 1
who 1
wanted 1
her 1
for 1
his 1
own 1
son 1
begged 1
the 1
sultan 1
to 1
withhold 1
her 1
for 1
three 1
months 1
in 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
hoped 1
his 1
son 1
could 1
contrive 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
a 1
richer 1
present 1
the 1
sultan 1
granted 1
this 1
and 1
told 1
aladdin 1
s 1
mother 1
that 1
though 1
he 1
consented 1
to 1
the 1
marriage 1
she 1
must 1
not 1
appear 1
before 1
him 1
again 1
for 1
three 1
months 1
aladdin 1
waited 1
patiently 1
for 1
nearly 1
three 1
months 1
but 1
after 1
two 1
had 1
elapsed 1
his 1
mother 1
going 1
into 1
the 1
city 1
to 1
buy 1
oil 1
found 1
everyone 1
rejoicing 1
and 1
asked 1
what 1
was 1
going 1
on 1
do 1
you 1
not 1
know 1
was 1
the 1
answer 1
that 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
the 1
grand 1
vizier 1
is 1
to 1
marry 1
the 1
sultan 1
s 1
daughter 1
tonight 1
breathless 1
she 1
ran 1
and 1
told 1
aladdin 1
who 1
was 1
overwhelmed 1
at 1
first 1
but 1
presently 1
bethought 1
him 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
he 1
rubbed 1
it 1
and 1
the 1
genie 1
appeared 1
saying 1
what 1
is 1
thy 1
will 1
aladdin 1
replied 1
the 1
sultan 1
as 1
thou 1
knowest 1
has 1
broken 1
his 1
promise 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
the 1
vizier 1
s 1
son 1
is 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
princess 1
my 1
command 1
is 1
that 1
to 1
night 1
you 1
bring 1
hither 1
the 1
bride 1
and 1
bridegroom 1
master 1
i 1
obey 1
said 1
the 1
genie 1
aladdin 1
then 1
went 1
to 1
his 1
chamber 1
where 1
sure 1
enough 1
at 1
midnight 1
the 1
genie 1
transported 1
the 1
bed 1
containing 1
the 1
vizier 1
s 1
son 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
take 1
this 1
new 1
married 1
man 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
put 1
him 1
outside 1
in 1
the 1
cold 1
and 1
return 1
at 1
daybreak 1
whereupon 1
the 1
genie 1
took 1
the 1
vizier 1
s 1
son 1
out 1
of 1
bed 1
leaving 1
aladdin 1
with 1
the 1
princess 1
fear 1
nothing 1
aladdin 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
you 1
are 1
my 1
wife 1
promised 1
to 1
me 1
by 1
your 1
unjust 1
father 1
and 1
no 1
harm 1
will 1
come 1
to 1
you 1
the 1
princess 1
was 1
too 1
frightened 1
to 1
speak 1
and 1
passed 1
the 1
most 1
miserable 1
night 1
of 1
her 1
life 1
while 1
aladdin 1
lay 1
down 1
beside 1
her 1
and 1
slept 1
soundly 1
at 1
the 1
appointed 1
hour 1
the 1
genie 1
fetched 1
in 1
the 1
shivering 1
bridegroom 1
laid 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
place 1
and 1
transported 1
the 1
bed 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
palace 1
presently 1
the 1
sultan 1
came 1
to 1
wish 1
his 1
daughter 1
good 1
morning 1
the 1
unhappy 1
vizier 1
s 1
son 1
jumped 1
up 1
and 1
hid 1
himself 1
while 1
the 1
princess 1
would 1
not 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
and 1
was 1
very 1
sorrowful 1
the 1
sultan 1
sent 1
her 1
mother 1
to 1
her 1
who 1
said 1
how 1
comes 1
it 1
child 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
speak 1
to 1
your 1
father 1
what 1
has 1
happened 1
the 1
princess 1
sighed 1
deeply 1
and 1
at 1
last 1
told 1
her 1
mother 1
how 1
during 1
the 1
night 1
the 1
bed 1
had 1
been 1
carried 1
into 1
some 1
strange 1
house 1
and 1
what 1
had 1
passed 1
there 1
her 1
mother 1
did 1
not 1
believe 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
least 1
but 1
bade 1
her 1
rise 1
and 1
consider 1
it 1
an 1
idle 1
dream 1
the 1
following 1
night 1
exactly 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
happened 1
and 1
next 1
morning 1
on 1
the 1
princess 1
s 1
refusing 1
to 1
speak 1
the 1
sultan 1
threatened 1
to 1
cut 1
off 1
her 1
head 1
she 1
then 1
confessed 1
all 1
bidding 1
him 1
ask 1
the 1
vizier 1
s 1
son 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
not 1
so 1
the 1
sultan 1
told 1
the 1
vizier 1
to 1
ask 1
his 1
son 1
who 1
owned 1
the 1
truth 1
adding 1
that 1
dearly 1
as 1
he 1
loved 1
the 1
princess 1
he 1
had 1
rather 1
die 1
than 1
go 1
through 1
another 1
such 1
fearful 1
night 1
and 1
wished 1
to 1
be 1
separated 1
from 1
her 1
his 1
wish 1
was 1
granted 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
end 1
of 1
feasting 1
and 1
rejoicing 1
when 1
the 1
three 1
months 1
were 1
over 1
aladdin 1
sent 1
his 1
mother 1
to 1
remind 1
the 1
sultan 1
of 1
his 1
promise 1
she 1
stood 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
place 1
as 1
before 1
and 1
the 1
sultan 1
who 1
had 1
forgotten 1
aladdin 1
at 1
once 1
remembered 1
him 1
and 1
sent 1
for 1
her 1
on 1
seeing 1
her 1
poverty 1
the 1
sultan 1
felt 1
less 1
inclined 1
than 1
ever 1
to 1
keep 1
his 1
word 1
and 1
asked 1
his 1
vizier 1
s 1
advice 1
who 1
counselled 1
him 1
to 1
set 1
so 1
high 1
a 1
value 1
on 1
the 1
princess 1
that 1
no 1
man 1
living 1
would 1
come 1
up 1
to 1
it 1
the 1
sultan 1
than 1
turned 1
to 1
aladdin 1
s 1
mother 1
saying 1
good 1
woman 1
a 1
sultan 1
must 1
remember 1
his 1
promises 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
remember 1
mine 1
but 1
your 1
son 1
must 1
first 1
send 1
me 1
forty 1
basins 1
of 1
gold 1
brimful 1
of 1
jewels 1
carried 1
by 1
forty 1
black 1
slaves 1
led 1
by 1
as 1
many 1
white 1
ones 1
splendidly 1
dressed 1
tell 1
him 1
that 1
i 1
await 1
his 1
answer 1
the 1
mother 1
of 1
aladdin 1
bowed 1
low 1
and 1
went 1
home 1
thinking 1
all 1
was 1
lost 1
she 1
gave 1
aladdin 1
the 1
message 1
adding 1
he 1
may 1
wait 1
long 1
enough 1
for 1
your 1
answer 1
not 1
so 1
long 1
mother 1
as 1
you 1
think 1
her 1
son 1
replied 1
i 1
would 1
do 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
more 1
than 1
that 1
for 1
the 1
princess 1
he 1
summoned 1
the 1
genie 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
moments 1
the 1
eighty 1
slaves 1
arrived 1
and 1
filled 1
up 1
the 1
small 1
house 1
and 1
garden 1
aladdin 1
made 1
them 1
to 1
set 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
palace 1
two 1
by 1
two 1
followed 1
by 1
his 1
mother 1
they 1
were 1
so 1
richly 1
dressed 1
with 1
such 1
splendid 1
jewels 1
that 1
everyone 1
crowded 1
to 1
see 1
them 1
and 1
the 1
basins 1
of 1
gold 1
they 1
carried 1
on 1
their 1
heads 1
they 1
entered 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
after 1
kneeling 1
before 1
the 1
sultan 1
stood 1
in 1
a 1
half 1
circle 1
round 1
the 1
throne 1
with 1
their 1
arms 1
crossed 1
while 1
aladdin 1
s 1
mother 1
presented 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
sultan 1
he 1
hesitated 1
no 1
longer 1
but 1
said 1
good 1
woman 1
return 1
and 1
tell 1
your 1
son 1
that 1
i 1
wait 1
for 1
him 1
with 1
open 1
arms 1
she 1
lost 1
no 1
time 1
in 1
telling 1
aladdin 1
bidding 1
him 1
make 1
haste 1
but 1
aladdin 1
first 1
called 1
the 1
genie 1
i 1
want 1
a 1
scented 1
bath 1
he 1
said 1
a 1
richly 1
embroidered 1
habit 1
a 1
horse 1
surpassing 1
the 1
sultan 1
s 1
and 1
twenty 1
slaves 1
to 1
attend 1
me 1
besides 1
this 1
six 1
slaves 1
beautifully 1
dressed 1
to 1
wait 1
on 1
my 1
mother 1
and 1
lastly 1
ten 1
thousand 1
pieces 1
of 1
gold 1
in 1
ten 1
purses 1
no 1
sooner 1
said 1
then 1
done 1
aladdin 1
mounted 1
his 1
horse 1
and 1
passed 1
through 1
the 1
streets 1
the 1
slaves 1
strewing 1
gold 1
as 1
they 1
went 1
those 1
who 1
had 1
played 1
with 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
childhood 1
knew 1
him 1
not 1
he 1
had 1
grown 1
so 1
handsome 1
when 1
the 1
sultan 1
saw 1
him 1
he 1
came 1
down 1
from 1
his 1
throne 1
embraced 1
him 1
and 1
led 1
him 1
into 1
a 1
hall 1
where 1
a 1
feast 1
was 1
spread 1
intending 1
to 1
marry 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
princess 1
that 1
very 1
day 1
but 1
aladdin 1
refused 1
saying 1
i 1
must 1
build 1
a 1
palace 1
fit 1
for 1
her 1
and 1
took 1
his 1
leave 1
once 1
home 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
genie 1
build 1
me 1
a 1
palace 1
of 1
the 1
finest 1
marble 1
set 1
with 1
jasper 1
agate 1
and 1
other 1
precious 1
stones 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
you 1
shall 1
build 1
me 1
a 1
large 1
hall 1
with 1
a 1
dome 1
its 1
four 1
walls 1
of 1
massy 1
gold 1
and 1
silver 1
each 1
side 1
having 1
six 1
windows 1
whose 1
lattices 1
all 1
except 1
one 1
which 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
left 1
unfinished 1
must 1
be 1
set 1
with 1
diamonds 1
and 1
rubies 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
stables 1
and 1
horses 1
and 1
grooms 1
and 1
slaves 1
go 1
and 1
see 1
about 1
it 1
the 1
palace 1
was 1
finished 1
the 1
next 1
day 1
and 1
the 1
genie 1
carried 1
him 1
there 1
and 1
showed 1
him 1
all 1
his 1
orders 1
faithfully 1
carried 1
out 1
even 1
to 1
the 1
laying 1
of 1
a 1
velvet 1
carpet 1
from 1
aladdin 1
s 1
palace 1
to 1
the 1
sultan 1
s 1
aladdin 1
s 1
mother 1
then 1
dressed 1
herself 1
carefully 1
and 1
walked 1
to 1
the 1
palace 1
with 1
her 1
slaves 1
while 1
he 1
followed 1
her 1
on 1
horseback 1
the 1
sultan 1
sent 1
musicians 1
with 1
trumpets 1
and 1
cymbals 1
to 1
meet 1
them 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
air 1
resounded 1
with 1
music 1
and 1
cheers 1
she 1
was 1
taken 1
to 1
the 1
princess 1
who 1
saluted 1
her 1
and 1
treated 1
her 1
with 1
great 1
honour 1
at 1
night 1
the 1
princess 1
said 1
good 1
bye 1
to 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
carpet 1
for 1
aladdin 1
s 1
palace 1
with 1
his 1
mother 1
at 1
her 1
side 1
and 1
followed 1
by 1
the 1
hundred 1
slaves 1
she 1
was 1
charmed 1
at 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
aladdin 1
who 1
ran 1
to 1
receive 1
her 1
princess 1
he 1
said 1
blame 1
your 1
beauty 1
for 1
my 1
boldness 1
if 1
i 1
have 1
displeased 1
you 1
she 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
having 1
seen 1
him 1
she 1
willingly 1
obeyed 1
her 1
father 1
in 1
this 1
matter 1
after 1
the 1
wedding 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
aladdin 1
led 1
her 1
into 1
the 1
hall 1
where 1
a 1
feast 1
was 1
spread 1
and 1
she 1
supped 1
with 1
him 1
after 1
which 1
they 1
danced 1
till 1
midnight 1
next 1
day 1
aladdin 1
invited 1
the 1
sultan 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
palace 1
on 1
entering 1
the 1
hall 1
with 1
the 1
four 1
and 1
twenty 1
windows 1
with 1
their 1
rubies 1
diamonds 1
and 1
emeralds 1
he 1
cried 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
world 1
s 1
wonder 1
there 1
is 1
only 1
one 1
thing 1
that 1
surprises 1
me 1
was 1
it 1
by 1
accident 1
that 1
one 1
window 1
was 1
left 1
unfinished 1
no 1
sir 1
by 1
design 1
returned 1
aladdin 1
i 1
wished 1
your 1
majesty 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
glory 1
of 1
finishing 1
this 1
palace 1
the 1
sultan 1
was 1
pleased 1
and 1
sent 1
for 1
the 1
best 1
jewelers 1
in 1
the 1
city 1
he 1
showed 1
them 1
the 1
unfinished 1
window 1
and 1
bade 1
them 1
fit 1
it 1
up 1
like 1
the 1
others 1
sir 1
replied 1
their 1
spokesman 1
we 1
cannot 1
find 1
jewels 1
enough 1
the 1
sultan 1
had 1
his 1
own 1
fetched 1
which 1
they 1
soon 1
used 1
but 1
to 1
no 1
purpose 1
for 1
in 1
a 1
month 1
s 1
time 1
the 1
work 1
was 1
not 1
half 1
done 1
aladdin 1
knowing 1
that 1
their 1
task 1
was 1
vain 1
bade 1
them 1
undo 1
their 1
work 1
and 1
carry 1
the 1
jewels 1
back 1
and 1
the 1
genie 1
finished 1
the 1
window 1
at 1
his 1
command 1
the 1
sultan 1
was 1
surprised 1
to 1
receive 1
his 1
jewels 1
again 1
and 1
visited 1
aladdin 1
who 1
showed 1
him 1
the 1
window 1
finished 1
the 1
sultan 1
embraced 1
him 1
the 1
envious 1
vizier 1
meanwhile 1
hinting 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
enchantment 1
aladdin 1
had 1
won 1
the 1
hearts 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
by 1
his 1
gentle 1
bearing 1
he 1
was 1
made 1
captain 1
of 1
the 1
sultan 1
s 1
armies 1
and 1
won 1
several 1
battles 1
for 1
him 1
but 1
remained 1
as 1
courteous 1
as 1
before 1
and 1
lived 1
thus 1
in 1
peace 1
and 1
content 1
for 1
several 1
years 1
but 1
far 1
away 1
in 1
africa 1
the 1
magician 1
remembered 1
aladdin 1
and 1
by 1
his 1
magic 1
arts 1
discovered 1
that 1
aladdin 1
instead 1
of 1
perishing 1
miserably 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
had 1
escaped 1
and 1
had 1
married 1
a 1
princess 1
with 1
whom 1
he 1
was 1
living 1
in 1
great 1
honour 1
and 1
wealth 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
the 1
poor 1
tailor 1
s 1
son 1
could 1
only 1
have 1
accomplished 1
this 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
travelled 1
night 1
and 1
day 1
till 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
capital 1
of 1
china 1
bent 1
on 1
aladdin 1
s 1
ruin 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
through 1
the 1
town 1
he 1
heard 1
people 1
talking 1
everywhere 1
about 1
a 1
marvelous 1
palace 1
forgive 1
my 1
ignorance 1
he 1
asked 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
palace 1
you 1
speak 1
of 1
have 1
you 1
not 1
heard 1
of 1
prince 1
aladdin 1
s 1
palace 1
was 1
the 1
reply 1
the 1
greatest 1
wonder 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
i 1
will 1
direct 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
mind 1
to 1
see 1
it 1
the 1
magician 1
thanked 1
him 1
who 1
spoke 1
and 1
having 1
seen 1
the 1
palace 1
knew 1
that 1
it 1
had 1
been 1
raised 1
by 1
the 1
genie 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
became 1
half 1
mad 1
with 1
rage 1
he 1
determined 1
to 1
get 1
hold 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
again 1
plunge 1
aladdin 1
into 1
the 1
deepest 1
poverty 1
unluckily 1
aladdin 1
had 1
gone 1
a 1
hunting 1
for 1
eight 1
days 1
which 1
gave 1
the 1
magician 1
plenty 1
of 1
time 1
he 1
bought 1
a 1
dozen 1
lamps 1
put 1
them 1
into 1
a 1
basket 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
palace 1
crying 1
new 1
lamps 1
for 1
old 1
followed 1
by 1
a 1
jeering 1
crowd 1
the 1
princess 1
sitting 1
in 1
the 1
hall 1
of 1
four 1
and 1
twenty 1
windows 1
sent 1
a 1
slave 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
what 1
the 1
noise 1
was 1
about 1
who 1
came 1
back 1
laughing 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
princess 1
scolded 1
her 1
madam 1
replied 1
the 1
slave 1
who 1
can 1
help 1
laughing 1
to 1
see 1
an 1
old 1
fool 1
offering 1
to 1
exchange 1
fine 1
new 1
lamps 1
for 1
old 1
ones 1
another 1
slave 1
hearing 1
this 1
said 1
there 1
is 1
an 1
old 1
one 1
on 1
the 1
cornice 1
there 1
which 1
he 1
can 1
have 1
now 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
magic 1
lamp 1
which 1
aladdin 1
had 1
left 1
there 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
take 1
it 1
out 1
hunting 1
with 1
him 1
the 1
princess 1
not 1
knowing 1
its 1
value 1
laughingly 1
bade 1
the 1
slave 1
take 1
it 1
and 1
make 1
the 1
exchange 1
she 1
went 1
and 1
said 1
to 1
the 1
magician 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
new 1
lamp 1
for 1
this 1
he 1
snatched 1
it 1
and 1
bade 1
the 1
slave 1
take 1
her 1
choice 1
amid 1
the 1
jeers 1
of 1
the 1
crowd 1
little 1
he 1
cared 1
but 1
left 1
off 1
crying 1
his 1
lamps 1
and 1
went 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
city 1
gates 1
to 1
a 1
lonely 1
place 1
where 1
he 1
remained 1
till 1
nightfall 1
when 1
he 1
pulled 1
out 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
rubbed 1
it 1
the 1
genie 1
appeared 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
magician 1
s 1
command 1
carried 1
him 1
together 1
with 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
in 1
it 1
to 1
a 1
lonely 1
place 1
in 1
africa 1
next 1
morning 1
the 1
sultan 1
looked 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
towards 1
aladdin 1
s 1
palace 1
and 1
rubbed 1
his 1
eyes 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
gone 1
he 1
sent 1
for 1
the 1
vizier 1
and 1
asked 1
what 1
had 1
become 1
of 1
the 1
palace 1
the 1
vizier 1
looked 1
out 1
too 1
and 1
was 1
lost 1
in 1
astonishment 1
he 1
again 1
put 1
it 1
down 1
to 1
enchantment 1
and 1
this 1
time 1
the 1
sultan 1
believed 1
him 1
and 1
sent 1
thirty 1
men 1
on 1
horseback 1
to 1
fetch 1
aladdin 1
back 1
in 1
chains 1
they 1
met 1
him 1
riding 1
home 1
bound 1
him 1
and 1
forced 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
with 1
them 1
on 1
foot 1
the 1
people 1
however 1
who 1
loved 1
him 1
followed 1
armed 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
no 1
harm 1
he 1
was 1
carried 1
before 1
the 1
sultan 1
who 1
ordered 1
the 1
executioner 1
to 1
cut 1
off 1
his 1
head 1
the 1
executioner 1
made 1
aladdin 1
kneel 1
down 1
bandaged 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
raised 1
his 1
scimitar 1
to 1
strike 1
at 1
that 1
instant 1
the 1
vizier 1
who 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
crowd 1
had 1
forced 1
their 1
way 1
into 1
the 1
courtyard 1
and 1
were 1
scaling 1
the 1
walls 1
to 1
rescue 1
aladdin 1
called 1
to 1
the 1
executioner 1
to 1
stay 1
his 1
hand 1
the 1
people 1
indeed 1
looked 1
so 1
threatening 1
that 1
the 1
sultan 1
gave 1
way 1
and 1
ordered 1
aladdin 1
to 1
be 1
unbound 1
and 1
pardoned 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
crowd 1
aladdin 1
now 1
begged 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
false 1
wretch 1
said 1
the 1
sultan 1
come 1
hither 1
and 1
showed 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
his 1
palace 1
had 1
stood 1
aladdin 1
was 1
so 1
amazed 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
say 1
a 1
word 1
where 1
is 1
your 1
palace 1
and 1
my 1
daughter 1
demanded 1
the 1
sultan 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
so 1
deeply 1
concerned 1
but 1
my 1
daughter 1
i 1
must 1
have 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
find 1
her 1
or 1
lose 1
your 1
head 1
aladdin 1
begged 1
for 1
forty 1
days 1
in 1
which 1
to 1
find 1
her 1
promising 1
if 1
he 1
failed 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
suffer 1
death 1
at 1
the 1
sultan 1
s 1
pleasure 1
his 1
prayer 1
was 1
granted 1
and 1
he 1
went 1
forth 1
sadly 1
from 1
the 1
sultan 1
s 1
presence 1
for 1
three 1
days 1
he 1
wandered 1
about 1
like 1
a 1
madman 1
asking 1
everyone 1
what 1
had 1
become 1
of 1
his 1
palace 1
but 1
they 1
only 1
laughed 1
and 1
pitied 1
him 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
banks 1
of 1
a 1
river 1
and 1
knelt 1
down 1
to 1
say 1
his 1
prayers 1
before 1
throwing 1
himself 1
in 1
in 1
doing 1
so 1
he 1
rubbed 1
the 1
ring 1
he 1
still 1
wore 1
the 1
genie 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
in 1
the 1
cave 1
appeared 1
and 1
asked 1
his 1
will 1
save 1
my 1
life 1
genie 1
said 1
aladdin 1
and 1
bring 1
my 1
palace 1
back 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
said 1
the 1
genie 1
i 1
am 1
only 1
the 1
slave 1
of 1
the 1
ring 1
you 1
must 1
ask 1
him 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
even 1
so 1
said 1
aladdin 1
but 1
thou 1
canst 1
take 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
set 1
me 1
down 1
under 1
my 1
dear 1
wife 1
s 1
window 1
he 1
at 1
once 1
found 1
himself 1
in 1
africa 1
under 1
the 1
window 1
of 1
the 1
princess 1
and 1
fell 1
asleep 1
out 1
of 1
sheer 1
weariness 1
he 1
was 1
awakened 1
by 1
the 1
singing 1
of 1
the 1
birds 1
and 1
his 1
heart 1
was 1
lighter 1
he 1
saw 1
plainly 1
that 1
all 1
his 1
misfortunes 1
were 1
owning 1
to 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
vainly 1
wondered 1
who 1
had 1
robbed 1
him 1
of 1
it 1
that 1
morning 1
the 1
princess 1
rose 1
earlier 1
than 1
she 1
had 1
done 1
since 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
carried 1
into 1
africa 1
by 1
the 1
magician 1
whose 1
company 1
she 1
was 1
forced 1
to 1
endure 1
once 1
a 1
day 1
she 1
however 1
treated 1
him 1
so 1
harshly 1
that 1
he 1
dared 1
not 1
live 1
there 1
altogether 1
as 1
she 1
was 1
dressing 1
one 1
of 1
her 1
women 1
looked 1
out 1
and 1
saw 1
aladdin 1
the 1
princess 1
ran 1
and 1
opened 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
noise 1
she 1
made 1
aladdin 1
looked 1
up 1
she 1
called 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
great 1
was 1
the 1
joy 1
of 1
these 1
lovers 1
at 1
seeing 1
each 1
other 1
again 1
after 1
he 1
had 1
kissed 1
her 1
aladdin 1
said 1
i 1
beg 1
of 1
you 1
princess 1
in 1
god 1
s 1
name 1
before 1
we 1
speak 1
of 1
anything 1
else 1
for 1
your 1
own 1
sake 1
and 1
mine 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
has 1
become 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
lamp 1
i 1
left 1
on 1
the 1
cornice 1
in 1
the 1
hall 1
of 1
four 1
and 1
twenty 1
windows 1
when 1
i 1
went 1
a 1
hunting 1
alas 1
she 1
said 1
i 1
am 1
the 1
innocent 1
cause 1
of 1
our 1
sorrows 1
and 1
told 1
him 1
of 1
the 1
exchange 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
now 1
i 1
know 1
cried 1
aladdin 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
thank 1
the 1
african 1
magician 1
for 1
this 1
where 1
is 1
the 1
lamp 1
he 1
carries 1
it 1
about 1
with 1
him 1
said 1
the 1
princess 1
i 1
know 1
for 1
he 1
pulled 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
breast 1
to 1
show 1
me 1
he 1
wishes 1
me 1
to 1
break 1
my 1
faith 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
marry 1
him 1
saying 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
beheaded 1
by 1
my 1
father 1
s 1
command 1
he 1
is 1
forever 1
speaking 1
ill 1
of 1
you 1
but 1
i 1
only 1
reply 1
by 1
my 1
tears 1
if 1
i 1
persist 1
i 1
doubt 1
not 1
but 1
he 1
will 1
use 1
violence 1
aladdin 1
comforted 1
her 1
and 1
left 1
her 1
for 1
a 1
while 1
he 1
changed 1
clothes 1
with 1
the 1
first 1
person 1
he 1
met 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
and 1
having 1
bought 1
a 1
certain 1
powder 1
returned 1
to 1
the 1
princess 1
who 1
let 1
him 1
in 1
by 1
a 1
little 1
side 1
door 1
put 1
on 1
your 1
most 1
beautiful 1
dress 1
he 1
said 1
to 1
her 1
and 1
receive 1
the 1
magician 1
with 1
smiles 1
leading 1
him 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
forgotten 1
me 1
invite 1
him 1
to 1
sup 1
with 1
you 1
and 1
say 1
you 1
wish 1
to 1
taste 1
the 1
wine 1
of 1
his 1
country 1
he 1
will 1
go 1
for 1
some 1
and 1
while 1
he 1
is 1
gone 1
i 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
what 1
to 1
do 1
she 1
listened 1
carefully 1
to 1
aladdin 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
left 1
her 1
arrayed 1
herself 1
gaily 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
since 1
she 1
left 1
china 1
she 1
put 1
on 1
a 1
girdle 1
and 1
head 1
dress 1
of 1
diamonds 1
and 1
seeing 1
in 1
a 1
glass 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
more 1
beautiful 1
than 1
ever 1
received 1
the 1
magician 1
saying 1
to 1
his 1
great 1
amazement 1
i 1
have 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
that 1
aladdin 1
is 1
dead 1
and 1
that 1
all 1
my 1
tears 1
will 1
not 1
bring 1
him 1
back 1
to 1
me 1
so 1
i 1
am 1
resolved 1
to 1
mourn 1
no 1
more 1
and 1
have 1
therefore 1
invited 1
you 1
to 1
sup 1
with 1
me 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
tired 1
of 1
the 1
wines 1
of 1
china 1
and 1
would 1
fain 1
taste 1
those 1
of 1
africa 1
the 1
magician 1
flew 1
to 1
his 1
cellar 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
put 1
the 1
powder 1
aladdin 1
had 1
given 1
her 1
in 1
her 1
cup 1
when 1
he 1
returned 1
she 1
asked 1
him 1
to 1
drink 1
her 1
health 1
in 1
the 1
wine 1
of 1
africa 1
handing 1
him 1
her 1
cup 1
in 1
exchange 1
for 1
his 1
as 1
a 1
sign 1
she 1
was 1
reconciled 1
to 1
him 1
before 1
drinking 1
the 1
magician 1
made 1
her 1
a 1
speech 1
in 1
praise 1
of 1
her 1
beauty 1
but 1
the 1
princess 1
cut 1
him 1
short 1
saying 1
let 1
us 1
drink 1
first 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
say 1
what 1
you 1
will 1
afterwards 1
she 1
set 1
her 1
cup 1
to 1
her 1
lips 1
and 1
kept 1
it 1
there 1
while 1
the 1
magician 1
drained 1
his 1
to 1
the 1
dregs 1
and 1
fell 1
back 1
lifeless 1
the 1
princess 1
then 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
to 1
aladdin 1
and 1
flung 1
her 1
arms 1
around 1
his 1
neck 1
but 1
aladdin 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
dead 1
magician 1
took 1
the 1
lamp 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
vest 1
and 1
bade 1
the 1
genie 1
carry 1
the 1
palace 1
and 1
all 1
in 1
it 1
back 1
to 1
china 1
this 1
was 1
done 1
and 1
the 1
princess 1
in 1
her 1
chamber 1
felt 1
only 1
two 1
little 1
shocks 1
and 1
little 1
thought 1
she 1
was 1
home 1
again 1
the 1
sultan 1
who 1
was 1
sitting 1
in 1
his 1
closet 1
mourning 1
for 1
his 1
lost 1
daughter 1
happened 1
to 1
look 1
up 1
and 1
rubbed 1
his 1
eyes 1
for 1
there 1
stood 1
the 1
palace 1
as 1
before 1
he 1
hastened 1
thither 1
and 1
aladdin 1
received 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
hall 1
of 1
the 1
four 1
and 1
twenty 1
windows 1
with 1
the 1
princess 1
at 1
his 1
side 1
aladdin 1
told 1
him 1
what 1
had 1
happened 1
and 1
showed 1
him 1
the 1
dead 1
body 1
of 1
the 1
magician 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
believe 1
a 1
ten 1
days 1
feast 1
was 1
proclaimed 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
as 1
if 1
aladdin 1
might 1
now 1
live 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
in 1
peace 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
meant 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
african 1
magician 1
had 1
a 1
younger 1
brother 1
who 1
was 1
if 1
possible 1
more 1
wicked 1
and 1
more 1
cunning 1
than 1
himself 1
he 1
travelled 1
to 1
china 1
to 1
avenge 1
his 1
brother 1
s 1
death 1
and 1
went 1
to 1
visit 1
a 1
pious 1
woman 1
called 1
fatima 1
thinking 1
she 1
might 1
be 1
of 1
use 1
to 1
him 1
he 1
entered 1
her 1
cell 1
and 1
clapped 1
a 1
dagger 1
to 1
her 1
breast 1
telling 1
her 1
to 1
rise 1
and 1
do 1
his 1
bidding 1
on 1
pain 1
of 1
death 1
he 1
changed 1
clothes 1
with 1
her 1
coloured 1
his 1
face 1
like 1
hers 1
put 1
on 1
her 1
veil 1
and 1
murdered 1
her 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
tell 1
no 1
tales 1
then 1
he 1
went 1
towards 1
the 1
palace 1
of 1
aladdin 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
people 1
thinking 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
holy 1
woman 1
gathered 1
round 1
him 1
kissing 1
his 1
hands 1
and 1
begging 1
his 1
blessing 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
to 1
the 1
palace 1
there 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
noise 1
going 1
on 1
round 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
princess 1
bade 1
her 1
slave 1
look 1
out 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
ask 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
matter 1
the 1
slave 1
said 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
holy 1
woman 1
curing 1
people 1
by 1
her 1
touch 1
of 1
their 1
ailments 1
whereupon 1
the 1
princess 1
who 1
had 1
long 1
desired 1
to 1
see 1
fatima 1
sent 1
for 1
her 1
on 1
coming 1
to 1
the 1
princess 1
the 1
magician 1
offered 1
up 1
a 1
prayer 1
for 1
her 1
health 1
and 1
prosperity 1
when 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
the 1
princess 1
made 1
him 1
sit 1
by 1
her 1
and 1
begged 1
him 1
to 1
stay 1
with 1
her 1
always 1
the 1
false 1
fatima 1
who 1
wished 1
for 1
nothing 1
better 1
consented 1
but 1
kept 1
his 1
veil 1
down 1
for 1
fear 1
of 1
discovery 1
the 1
princess 1
showed 1
him 1
the 1
hall 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
what 1
he 1
thought 1
of 1
it 1
it 1
is 1
truly 1
beautiful 1
said 1
the 1
false 1
fatima 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
it 1
wants 1
but 1
one 1
thing 1
and 1
what 1
is 1
that 1
said 1
the 1
princess 1
if 1
only 1
a 1
roc 1
s 1
egg 1
replied 1
he 1
were 1
hung 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
this 1
dome 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
wonder 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
after 1
this 1
the 1
princess 1
could 1
think 1
of 1
nothing 1
but 1
the 1
roc 1
s 1
egg 1
and 1
when 1
aladdin 1
returned 1
from 1
hunting 1
he 1
found 1
her 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
ill 1
humour 1
he 1
begged 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
was 1
amiss 1
and 1
she 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
all 1
her 1
pleasure 1
in 1
the 1
hall 1
was 1
spoilt 1
for 1
want 1
of 1
a 1
roc 1
s 1
egg 1
hanging 1
from 1
the 1
dome 1
if 1
that 1
is 1
all 1
replied 1
aladdin 1
you 1
shall 1
soon 1
be 1
happy 1
he 1
left 1
her 1
and 1
rubbed 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
genie 1
appeared 1
commanded 1
him 1
to 1
bring 1
a 1
roc 1
s 1
egg 1
the 1
genie 1
gave 1
such 1
a 1
loud 1
and 1
terrible 1
shriek 1
that 1
the 1
hall 1
shook 1
wretch 1
he 1
cried 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
enough 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
everything 1
for 1
you 1
but 1
you 1
must 1
command 1
me 1
to 1
bring 1
my 1
master 1
and 1
hang 1
him 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
this 1
dome 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
wife 1
and 1
your 1
palace 1
deserve 1
to 1
be 1
burnt 1
to 1
ashes 1
but 1
that 1
this 1
request 1
does 1
not 1
come 1
from 1
you 1
but 1
from 1
the 1
brother 1
of 1
the 1
african 1
magician 1
whom 1
you 1
destroyed 1
he 1
is 1
now 1
in 1
your 1
palace 1
disguised 1
as 1
the 1
holy 1
woman 1
whom 1
he 1
murdered 1
he 1
it 1
was 1
who 1
put 1
that 1
wish 1
into 1
your 1
wife 1
s 1
head 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
yourself 1
for 1
he 1
means 1
to 1
kill 1
you 1
so 1
saying 1
the 1
genie 1
disappeared 1
aladdin 1
went 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
princess 1
saying 1
his 1
head 1
ached 1
and 1
requesting 1
that 1
the 1
holy 1
fatima 1
should 1
be 1
fetched 1
to 1
lay 1
her 1
hands 1
on 1
it 1
but 1
when 1
the 1
magician 1
came 1
near 1
aladdin 1
seizing 1
his 1
dagger 1
pierced 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
heart 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
done 1
cried 1
the 1
princess 1
you 1
have 1
killed 1
the 1
holy 1
woman 1
not 1
so 1
replied 1
aladdin 1
but 1
a 1
wicked 1
magician 1
and 1
told 1
her 1
of 1
how 1
she 1
had 1
been 1
deceived 1
